* The *name* of the field **does** matter. 
* The *order* of the fields **does not** matter.  


## Chat

```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "Chat",
    "EventBody": "Hello World!",
}    
```


## Drop Bomb ðŸ’£ onto a Square (for the Game of War)

Note: The "Value" field must be either 1 or 2.
It corresponds to Player 1 or Player 2.
Without entering that field, the message might be ignored.


```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "LaBomba",
    "Value": 1,
    "Location": 
    {
        "X": 0,
        "Y": 47,
    }
}    
```



## Update to the Next Generation (Life Update)

```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "LifeUpdate",
}
```




## Directly Change a Square (Life Change)


Currently, the Grid is 48 x 48.  So the Location coordinates _x_ and _y_ are in the range of [0, 47].


Values match with different kinds of squares (can depend on the game). 
For example, in "The Game of War":

* 0: neutral (empty)
* 1: player 1
* 2: player 2
* 3: fire
* 4: fading fire / fallout zone 
* 5: ''' 
* 6: '''


```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "LifeChange",
    "Value": 1,
    "Location": 
    {
        "X": 0,
        "Y": 47,
    }
}    
```


## Directly Change Multiple Squares

When you want many changes to be made within the same game tick:

```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "ChangeMany",
    "Changes": 
    [
        {
            "Value": 1,
            "Location": 
            {
                "X": 1,
                "Y": 10
            }
        },
        {
            "Value": 2,
            "Location": 
            {
                "X": 2,
                "Y": 20
            }
        }
    ]
}   
```



## Reset & Randomize Game Board


### Fresh Game 

A simple Reset of the game board, where every square becomes either player 1
or player 2.


```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "FreshGame"
}    
```


### Randomize Placements

The "Integer" Field is **optional**.  It is the number of squares to that will 
be placed on the board after the reset.  For example, if you set the "integer"
field to 1:  Then 1 square will be created at a random location on the 
game board, and will be randomly given to either player 1 or player 2.


```JSON 
{
    "EventType": "LifeRandomize",
    "Integer": 500,
}    
```
